<h3>Versions</h3>

<p>Version 2 is available for free on Android and iOS devices and comes with new benefits such as biometric (fingerprint/face) sign-in and auto-fill support on those devices.</p>

<p>Version 1 (web app) works on all devices and can be accessed from anywhere at <a href="https://keevault.pm">https://keevault.pm</a>.</p>

<p>You can mix and match between both versions seamlessly and rest assured that both use the latest secure encryption technology. Version 2 is simply an upgraded version and a way for us to donate our software to those that can’t pay for a subscription, as per our <a href="/pricing">pricing promise</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a comparison of the main differences between the two versions at the bottom of our <a href="/features">features</a> page.</p>

<p>There is also a version available in the Microsoft Edge extension store which we have officially published. Unfortunately, a Microsoft bug has prevented us from keeping this up to date in the same way that we do with other browsers. We’re hopeful that one day they will listen to us and fix the problem but until then we can’t recommend the use of a browser that forces its users to use outdated security software.</p>

<h2>KeePass Password Safe 2 plugin</h2>

<p>As well as working with the Kee Vault multi-device service, the Kee browser extension can link with KeePass Password Safe 2 if you download and install it and the required KeePassRPC.plgx plugin. All the steps and links you need to do this are <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23">available on the community forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you subscribe to our Kee Vault subscription you can even connect your Kee browser extension to both Kee Vault and KeePass Password Safe at the same time.</p>

<h2>Other applications</h2>

<p>Modern web browsers aren’t the only apps that can be enhanced by the Kee browser extension. You can find advice on how to use KeeBird and KeeFox (an old version of Kee) in Thunderbird and other older web browsers based on Mozilla Firefox in our <a href="https://forum.kee.pm">community forum</a>.</p>
