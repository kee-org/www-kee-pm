### Pricing and Benefits

Our "Supporter Monthly" subscription is only £2 per month. Until the more expensive subscription plans are launched, all Supporters get access to all newly developed features of those plans.

We don’t offer refunds on partially used subscriptions but with the free trial and very cheap monthly subscription option we hope this seems reasonable to you.

## KeePass Password Safe 2 plugin

As well as working with the Kee Vault multi-device service, the Kee browser extension can link with KeePass Password Safe 2 if you download and install it and the required KeePassRPC.plgx plugin. All the steps and links you need to do this are [available on the community forum](https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23).

If you subscribe to our upcoming Premium Kee Vault subscription you can even connect your Kee browser extension to both Kee Vault and KeePass Password Safe at the same time.
