<h3>Kee is OSI Certified Open Source Software</h3>

<p>Open source software has many benefits to you, not least of which is the cost. It is rare to find any open source software which costs money and Kee is no exception – it’s completely free.</p>

<p>Security software benefits even more so than other types of software. As has been demonstrated many times in recent decades, public and open security systems are far less likely to be compromised than their closed source equivalents.</p>

<p>The core principle actually dates back over 125 years and boils down to “security through obscurity is no security at all”, i.e. if your security relies on keeping the inner workings of your application secret it is likely that your security is already broken. You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle">read more on this topic</a> in the fountain of all knowledge (and its associated scientific paper references).</p>

<p>The latest source code is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon">https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon</a></p>

<h3>Other applications</h3>

<p>Modern web browsers aren't the only apps that can be enhanced by Kee. You can find advice on how to use KeeFox (the older version of Kee) in Thunderbird and other older web browsers based on Mozilla Firefox in our <a href="https://forum.kee.pm">community forum</a>.</p>
