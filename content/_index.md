<h3>Benefits and Versions</h3>

<p>Our easy-to-use Open Source password manager gives you peace of mind and saves you time. It works from all of your modern desktop and mobile devices and is based on proven Open Source security implementations.</p>

<p>Kee Vault comes in two versions:</p>

<p>Version 1 works on all modern devices and can be accessed from anywhere at <a href="https://keevault.pm">https://keevault.pm</a>.</p>
<p>Version 2 works only on modern Android devices and is the recommended version to use on Android due to its additional features.</p>

<p>You can mix and match between both versions seamlessly and rest assured that both use the latest secure encryption technology. Version 2 is simply an upgraded version and a way for us to donate our software to those that can't pay for a subscription, as per our <a href="/pricing">pricing promise</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>More detailed comparison between version 1 and 2: TODO (pricing options, fingerprints, autofill, future development plans, etc.)

<h2>KeePass Password Safe 2 plugin</h2>

<p>As well as working with the Kee Vault multi-device service, the Kee browser extension can link with KeePass Password Safe 2 if you download and install it and the required KeePassRPC.plgx plugin. All the steps and links you need to do this are <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/installing-kee-instructions/23">available on the community forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you subscribe to our upcoming Premium Kee Vault subscription you can even connect your Kee browser extension to both Kee Vault and KeePass Password Safe at the same time.</p>
