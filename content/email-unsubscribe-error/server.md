title: Email unsubscribe server error
---

We could not unsubscribe your email address from the "Introductory emails" mailing list.

We'll investigate the problem, try to prevent it from happening again and manually delete your subscription to the mailing list.

It could take a number of days for this to happen so we apologise in advance if our systems come back to life enough to send you more emails in the mean time.

Attempting again to unsubscribe immediately probably won't help but if you do get further "Kee Vault introductory" emails, by all means try again at that time.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
