title: Privacy policy for Kee browser extension
---

<p>The Kee browser extension has access to your extremely sensitive and personal data.</p>

<p>For this reason, we wish to include this privacy policy to explicitly state that none of this data ever leaves your system and none is ever able to be seen by others, even the publisher/maintainer of the extension. We simply do not have any desire to handle any personal data.</p>

<p>Note that while we naturally design Kee to prevent the transfer of your personal data to or through anything other than your private devices, this Privacy policy can not cover related products and services so you should inspect privacy policies of those as applicable. Some notable examples include your web browser, the Kee community forum and Kee Vault. When used with the optional Kee Vault password management service, some anonymous and non-personal data may flow between the add-on and the Kee Vault Service as per the Kee Vault Privacy Statement and Terms of Service.</p>
