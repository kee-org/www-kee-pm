This page lists the public hostnames and domains that we operate. You can use this page as a reference to help infer the legitimacy of various links and statements. We will keep it up to date.

For the purposes of validating the accuracy of this information, the following will be useful:

* We serve this page from the Netlify free CDN
* We host the canonical version of this data on GitHub (Microsoft) at https://github.com/kee-org/www-kee-pm/content/hostnames/_index.md
* While short-term differences between these sources could indicate an active update procedure or temporary caching, you should wait until both sources are in sync before trusting that no malicious modifications have been made on the CDN or between the CDN and your eyes.
* This hosting process does not directly protect against malicious modification of the source data by GitHub (Microsoft) although in most cases such modification would be detectable by other means.

Check the [@KeeVault twitter feed](https://twitter.com/keevault) for any statements that cast doubt on the validity of this information.
