title: Kee Vault Account Deletion

Sorry you're considering deleting your Kee Vault account. We want to help as many people as possible to access the best personal password manager so if there's anything we could do to help you to keep using your Kee Vault account, please check out our community forum where many solutions already exist and we'd be happy to hear your feedback.

We must protect your critical password data from malicious or accidental deletion - for many of our users account deletion could have disastrous personal and financial implications.

It is therefore very important that you read the information on this page because our deletion process may differ slightly from some other less-critical services you have previously used.

The main steps are:

1. Cancel your Kee Vault Subscription with your Subscription Provider
2. Either:
    1. Let our automatic account deletion system remove your data
    1. Delete your account data faster by completing the form below and responding to the email we send to your registered address

**To stop paying for your Kee Vault Subscription, you must use the Subscription Cancellation feature offered by your Subscription Provider.**

Deleting your account does not remove your obligation to pay your Subscription Provider for the ongoing service but you will no longer be able to access your account and will not be able to claim any refund for this situation.

Once your final Subscription term comes to an end, our automatic account deletion process will be activated.

This can take roughly 6 months but some data may be deleted before the end of this period.

Clicking the button below will request that we delete your account as quickly as possible.

* We will not cancel your Subscription - you must do this first to avoid incurring additional costs and automatically re-creating your account
* We will send you a reminder email after around 10 days
* We will delete your encrypted Vault (including all your passwords) after 21 days (the protection grace period)
* We will retain an encrypted copy of your email address for limited purposes and for a limited time, as described in our Privacy Policy.

## Things that will stop your account from being deleted

* Not cancelling your subscription first
* Not clicking on the confirmation link in the email we will send you
* Creating a new subscription for your account
* Registering for an account using the same email address as you currently use
* Clicking on the reset account confirmation link as part of the account reset process if you forget your password

Note that as described in more detail in other sections, some of these situations can still result in the complete loss of all data you stored in Kee Vault.

## Re-creating your account

You can simply use the usual account registration (sign up) web page or screen in our apps.

### During the protection grace period:

1. Submit the registration form
1. You will be told that the account already exists
1. You can then go back and sign in as normal

Signing in to your account will not automatically cancel the deletion process - you will need to submit the registration form first. Although it adds an extra step to the re-creation process, we think it could be surprising for a habitual sign-in to automatically override your stated preference for account deletion.

### After the protection grace period:

1. Submit the registration form

    All of your sensitive data is gone by this point and we simply create a new set of sign-in credentials, so your new password does not have to match the previous one.

OR

2. Re-enable your account subscription at your Subscription provider

    This won't work forever (depends on the subscription provider) but if you ask for it to be re-created, we should handle that all automatically for you and you would then sign in using the same credentials you previously used (or perform an account reset if you can't recall your main account password or want to start fresh with a new one).

There are many varied paths for re-enabling and the above isn't a comprehensive list of approaches that will work. There may also be some things you try that don't work - if you're struggling to re-enable a previously deleted account, please just get in touch and we can help.
