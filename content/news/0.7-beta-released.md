<p>KeeFox  0.7 has been released; this is the first Beta release of KeeFox. “Beta”  means that this release is ready for wider testing by advanced KeePass  users or other people with reasonable technical skills. While the  majority of major features are complete, there are a number of important  usability features that are incomplete and this may lead to confusion  for less experienced users. I hope that KeeFox is simple enough that you  will get by without documentation but I do intend to provide some  before the 1.0 release and you can of course post your queries or  comments in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewforum.php?f=1" target="_blank">forum</a>.
</p>
<p>If you identify a missing feature or possible bug, please search the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/report/1" target="_blank">tracker</a> before beginning a discussion in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewforum.php?f=1" target="_blank">forum</a>.
</p>
<p>All offers to help with items on the tracker are welcome. I would  prefer it if we could concentrate on the items slated for the 0.8  release but that’s not a strict rule so just get in touch if you think  you can help in any way. Some features may be dependant on other tasks  being completed first (this is less likely for 0.8 features).
