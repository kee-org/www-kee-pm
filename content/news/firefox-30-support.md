<p>Firefox 3.0 will <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/03/30/firefox-3-5-9-and-3-0-19-security-updates-now-available/" title="Go to https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/03/30/firefox-3-5-9-and-3-0-19-security-updates-now-available/" target="_blank" class="externlink">not be officially supported by Mozilla for much longer</a>  and some planned KeeFox features will be easier to implement if I  concentrate on version 3.5+ only. For these reasons, KeeFox version 0.8  will require Firefox 3.5+.
</p>
<p>I don’t plan to drop support for 3.5 until after the release of  KeeFox version 1.0 unless Mozilla officially withdraws support in the  mean-time. However, to ensure you’re getting the fastest and most secure  browsing experience, it is always advisable to upgrade to the latest  Firefox version as soon as possible.

<p>You can <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/upgrade.html" title="Go to http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/upgrade.html" target="_blank" class="externlink">download Firefox from the official site</a>.</p>
