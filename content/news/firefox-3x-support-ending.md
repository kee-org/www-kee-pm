<p>While  I want KeeFox to support as many Firefox versions as possible, there  does come a point where the security risks and development limitations  mean it is not practical to continue supporting older versions of  Firefox.
</p>
<p>Therefore from KeeFox version 1.1 onwards, only Firefox 4.0 and higher will be supported.
</p>
<p><strong>If you’re in the minority that still use Firefox 3.x please plan an upgrade within the next month</strong> in order to ensure you can keep up to date with the latest KeeFox version.
</p>
<p>Although I will try to support versions of Firefox earlier than the  current version (13 at the time of writing) it is always going to be  easier to support the latest version. The list below states the versions  of Firefox that KeeFox will support from now on. The list is in  priority order (so those users running versions lower down the list may  sometimes experience slower responses and fixes).
</p>
<p>1) The latest two stable versions of Firefox<br> 2) The latest extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox (released roughly once a year)<br> 3) The remaining stable versions since the current ESR<br> 4) The latest Firefox Beta<br> 5) The latest Aurora build (the version before beta)
</p>
<p>Many older versions will continue to work and we’ll not block the use  of KeeFox on other versions of Firefox until specific security threats  or functionality limitations arise. However, for the best security you  should adhere to Mozilla’s stricter upgrade advice wherever possible  (i.e. only <strong>use either the latest stable version or the ESR version</strong>).
</p>
<p>For example, at the time of writing KeeFox is supported on these Firefox versions in priority order:
</p>
<p>1) 12 and 13<br> 2) 10<br> 3) 11<br> 4) 14<br> 5) 15
</p>
<p>All other versions down to Firefox 4.0 should also work perfectly at the moment.
</p>
<p>I’ll add this information to the manual in due course.</p>
