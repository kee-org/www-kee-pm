<p>Fun fact: English reading KeeFox users are outnumbered by people that prefer to read other languages.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately English is the only language in which I can write so to  help the majority of KeeFox users to understand KeeFox I rely on the  great work of translators that donate their time to help translate  KeeFox into various languages.
</p>
<p>Some languages are already complete and able to be included with the  next version of KeeFox but most are not ready, including lots that are  available for the current version of KeeFox but will be removed soon if  they are not updated.
</p>
<p><strong>Over the next 10 days I hope that some of you will be able to <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" title="Go to https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">join the translation team</a> and translate some of KeeFox into your preferred language.</strong> It’s really easy to get started and you will:</p><ul><li>be able to practise writing English, probably learning a little new technical vocabulary along the way</li><li>help others who speak your language but do not understand English very well</li><li>be able to use KeeFox every day in your preferred language</li></ul><p>All translations completed by the 23rd February will be included in  the upcoming KeeFox 1.3 but any significant new translation work will  continue to be released to the beta testing channel every few weeks so  even incomplete work would be a huge step towards getting your language  into a future stable KeeFox release, even if it doesn’t quite make it  for version 1.3.0.
</p>
<p>We use a free website called <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" title="Go to https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">Transifex</a>  to translate KeeFox. There is good documentation available on their  website but the rough idea is that the text in KeeFox is divided up into  about 350 different snippets of text; Transifex shows you the English  “string” of text and asks you type in the equivalent text in your own  language.
</p>
<p>There are two “resources” in the KeeFox project - the “main” resource  which should be completed before a language can be included in the  stable version of KeeFox and the “FAMS” resource which contains the  messages and tips that help new users. While the translation of the  “FAMS” resource is important, I won’t hold back an otherwise complete  language translation if that resource is incomplete.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" title="Go to https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">Go to Transifex now to find out the status of your language</a> or read on for more detail.
</p>
<p>If you don’t see your language listed, you can request that it is added and I’ll try to respond quickly to your request.
</p>
<p>If your language is already translated, you can review the translation work done by others to help check for typos, etc.
</p>
<p>To test your translation you’ll need to use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/versions/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/versions/" target="_blank" class="externlink">beta version of KeeFox</a> but it’s essentially ready for release now so don’t let that put you off.
</p>
<p>At this time, the following translations will no longer be supported  in KeeFox 1.3 unless someone is able to help out with the translation:</p><ul><li>Czech</li><li>Danish</li><li>Dutch</li><li>Portuguese</li><li>Russian</li><li>Swedish (only 5 translations missing)</li></ul><p>The following translations have been started but not yet reached a  stage where they can be included in the stable KeeFox release:</p><ul><li>Italian</li><li>Korean</li><li>Hungarian</li><li>Norwegian</li><li>Polish</li><li>Romanian</li><li>Vietnamese</li></ul><p>Finally, the following languages have been added to Transifex because  they are popular among KeeFox users so it would be great if you are  able to devote a little time to translating these languages.</p><ul><li>Taiwanese</li><li>Finnish</li><li>Japanese</li><li>Spanish</li></ul><p>Thanks for reading and I hope you’ll join our translation team soon!</p>
