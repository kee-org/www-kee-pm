<p>A  new experimental development snapshot has recently been uploaded. If we  can’t find too many serious problems compared to version 0.7 then this  should become version 0.8 in a week or two.
</p>
<p>Some (of many) improvements since 0.7.3 include extra security  layers, password generation from within Firefox, a “getting started”  tutorial (needs special entries in your password database), logins  listed alphabetically and NTLM dialog autofill support.
</p>
<p>Most of those features were available in 0.7.6 (released a couple of  months ago); 0.7.7 also has all the improvements since 0.7 including  lots of options to fine tune KeeFox behaviour with specific entries  (albeit mostly through “advanced” strings rather than a pretty user  interface, which will hopefully be coming in an experimental version  soon after 0.8).
</p>
<p>If you’re comfortable with experimental software and can spare some  time to test it out, that would be very helpful. Please see the new <a href="http://experimental-version" target="_blank">experimental download page</a> for important upgrade instructions and a summary of any known issues.</p>
