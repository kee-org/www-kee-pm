<p>A new KeeFox version 0.8.10 is now available on the main download page.  This is still beta quality but I think it’s close to a release  candidate so please speak up if you find any problems. Top 10  highlights since 0.8.4 include: </p><ul><li> Support for Firefox 4 	</li><li>New “KeeFox” tab in the KeePass “edit group” and “edit entry” dialogs, giving easy access to features such as: <ul><li>Multiple matching URLs 	</li><li>Custom form field editing 	</li><li>Auto-fill and auto-submit override options </li></ul> </li><li>Entries can now be edited from the right-click / context menu on the matched login menu / button 	</li><li>The KeeFox options panel has been re-written to include options that  were previously hidden and clarify the purpose of some options 	</li><li> You can now choose to save entries straight into a sub-group or “Never for this site” 	</li><li> Improved detection of the “best” entry to use and the “best” form to put the entry into 	</li><li>“monitor[ing] each web page for new forms” no longer causes a “flashing” effect on the toolbar 	</li><li>A new “location manager” and an ability to set different home  groups for different locations via the “edit group” KeePass feature 	</li><li> HTTP Auth improvements (now uses the “realm” to improve auto-fill/submit accuracy and adds a tooltip showing the entry title) 	</li><li>You decide! There are scores of other changes so maybe your favourite improvement, new feature or bug fix deserves the #10 spot? </li></ul><p>Download KeeFox 0.8.10
</p>
<p>NB: Version 0.8.10 contains one fix since the experimental 0.8.8:  Multiple “additional URLs” no longer cause an entry to be ignored.</p>
