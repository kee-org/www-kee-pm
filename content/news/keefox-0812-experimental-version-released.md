<p>This new version is a release candidate candidate. Please help to test it so that I do not have to say that too many times!
</p>
<p>KeeFox is now “feature complete” as far as version 1.0 is concerned -  there are still many features I want to add later in the year but for   the next few months I will be concentrating on fixing bugs and ensuring  that the documentation and help resources are up to scratch before the  release of version 1.0. There may still be the occasional new feature   but only if it’s a low-risk with a high benefit to the “average” user.   Further details on future releases with new features will follow in the  coming months but in the mean time please help me test this version so  that I can have confidence in its suitability for a final release and   hence get started on the “post 1.0” feature requests as soon as  possible.
