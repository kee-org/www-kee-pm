<p>A new experimental version is available at <a href="download/experimental-version" title="Go to http://keefox.org/download/experimental-version" class="externlink">http://keefox.org/download/experimental-version</a>.  There are a couple of important bug fixes including one where some  other parts of Firefox stopped working when KeeFox was installed so I  recommend all users of 0.8.12-14 should upgrade. Users of 0.8.10 should  not be affected by this bug.
</p>
<p>The other improvements since 0.8.12 are: </p><p><ul><li>Improved password field matching 	</li><li>HTTP Auth dialogs now respect global and site-specific “offer to save passwords” settings </li></ul></p>
