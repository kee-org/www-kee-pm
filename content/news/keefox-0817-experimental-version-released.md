<p>Another release candidate candidate is <a href="download/experimental-version" title="Go to http://keefox.org/download/experimental-version" class="externlink">available for download</a>.
</p>
<p>This version now works with websites that have HTML5 form elements,  has more accurate HTTP Auth dialog entry matching, handles protected  password fields correctly and works with password database paths that  contain Unicode characters.
</p>
<p>Please could all experimental version users upgrade to this version because:
</p>
<p>1) You might not know if your form filling accuracy is affected by some of the bugs fixed in 0.8.17
</p>
<p>2) It will help give me confidence to release 0.8.17 to the wider  group of KeeFox users and stop having to write “release candidate  candidate”
</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think of the latest version!</p>
