<p>Version 0.8.20 has just been released - download it now.
</p>
<p>There may still be a few bugs here and there but I think the long  list of improvements since version 0.8.10 warrants a release now.
</p>
<p>There have been over 15 bug fixes along with some new features, the most notable being: </p><ul><li>Several username/password field matching improvements 	</li><li>HTTP Auth dialogs now prompt to save password </li></ul><p>All feedback is welcome, as always.
