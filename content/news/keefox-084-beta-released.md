<p>This  version includes several new features but the main benefit is a  stability improvement - some users have reported that earlier versions  of KeeFox can cause to Firefox to crash so after identifying a likely  fix for the issue I wanted to push this new beta onto the main download  page, despite there being a few rough edges. I think it works well  enough to be a worthwhile upgrade until I have more time to work on  features like Firefox 4 support.
</p>
<p>“Beta” means that this release is ready for wider testing by  advanced KeePass users or other people with reasonable technical  skills. While the majority of major features are complete, there are a   number of important usability features that are unfinished and this  may lead to confusion for less experienced users. I hope that KeeFox  is simple enough that you will get by without documentation but I do  intend to provide some before the 1.0 release and you can of course  post your queries or comments in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewforum.php?f=1" title="Go to https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewforum.php?f=1" target="_blank" class="externlink">forum</a>.

<p>All offers to help with items on the tracker are welcome. I would  prefer it if we could concentrate on the items slated for the 0.9 and  1.0 release but that’s not a strict rule so just get in touch if you  think you can help in any way. Some features may be dependant on other   tasks being completed first (this is less likely for 0.9 and 1.0  features).
