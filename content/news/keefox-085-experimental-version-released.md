<p>The latest experimental build is now available from the experimental download page.  As usual, this has been only briefly tested so expect the occasional  bug. This time around there are quite a few new features including the  following highlights.
</p>
<p>The “edit entry” and “edit group” dialogs in KeePass now have a new  “KeeFox” tab which allows point and click control of many advanced  features and options that were previously only available through manual   configuration of “advanced strings”. Features such as matching  alternative URLs and fine control over auto-fill and auto-submit  behaviour are just a couple of examples; A picture speaks a thousand  words so here are some screenshots:

</p>
<p>This feature is fairly large in scope and I’ve not yet been able to  test every way it can be used so please report any bugs you find and  speak up about any suggestions you have for future improvements in this   area.
</p>
<p>Logins can now be edited from the right-click / context menu on the  matched login menu / button. Combined with the new entry editing tab in   KeePass I think the process of refining KeePass entries to behave as  you intend should be much more streamlined and accessible to more  users.
</p>
<p>Also, the “remember installation location” option was broken - now it’s fixed, which should help portable KeePass/Firefox users.
</p>
<p>Last but not least, it should also more-or-less work in Firefox 4.  The two main areas that still need work for Firefox 4 support are the  setup wizard and HTTP authentication (and similar dialog boxes) but  there are likely to be numerous other bugs. Therefore note that if you  have trouble installing it into a fresh Firefox 4 profile, you may need  to first install into a 3.6 profile and upgrade the profile by running  Firefox 4 afterwards (or follow the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/wiki/Manual/Using%20KeeFox/Manual%20installation" title="Go to http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/wiki/Manual/Using%20KeeFox/Manual%20installation" target="_blank" class="externlink">manual installation</a> guidelines).</p>
