<p>Here’s another experimental version for your enjoyment.
</p>
<p>This one has several new features and some important bug fixes and  improvements to existing features. Please upgrade if you’re running an  experimental version at the moment; I hope to release this as a final  beta version before Firefox 4 is officially released (a couple of  weeks?) so all feedback can help me judge whether that is a good idea  or not!
</p>
<p>Highlights of this release are: </p><p><ul><li> Fixed: Auto-submit on HTTP Auth dialogs no longer closes the parent window (often closing Firefox as a result) 	</li><li> Fixed: “monitor[ing] each web page for new forms” no longer causes a “flashing” effect on the toolbar 	</li><li> Changing options no longer requires a restart of Firefox 	</li><li> KeePass entry dialog editor KeeFox tab is now split into three sub-tabs to make it less cramped 	</li><li> Improvements to the handling of locations: a new location manager  and the ability to set different home groups for different locations  via the “edit group” KeePass feature 	</li><li> Improved detection of the “best” password when multiple entries exist for the same domain 	</li><li> More complete list of matched logins on pages with matches in more than one frame 	</li><li> Improvements to the installer including: no longer overwriting  KeePass with the bundled version when manually setting the KeePass  location 	</li><li> HTTP Auth improvements (now uses the “realm” to improve auto-fill/submit accuracy and adds a tooltip showing the entry title) </li></ul></p>
