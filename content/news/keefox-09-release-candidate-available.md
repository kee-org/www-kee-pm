<p>You can now download version 0.9b from the development channel at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/</a>
</p>
<p>Users already subscribed to the development channel (i.e. running 0.8.22b at the moment) will be upgraded automatically.
</p>
<p>You can easily swap back to 0.8.21 if you find a problem with 0.9 so please try it out and post in the <a href="help/forum" title="Go to http://keefox.org/help/forum" class="externlink">forum</a> if you do find any new issues.
</p>
<p>Assuming a successful beta testing period, this version will be rolled out to all 0.8.21 users in a couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>This version is suitable for widespread use but may still contain a few bugs.
</p>
<p>This version has a few improvements to the features added in 0.8.22,   updates the default version of KeePass to 2.16 and adds the first two  (incomplete) translations: </p><ul><li>Swedish 	</li><li>Russian </li></ul><p>The previously unannounced version 0.8.22 also changes: </p><ul><li>FIXED: Editing passwords with KeePassRPC GUI sometimes showed an empty password 	</li><li>Master key entry dialog focuses correctly on all versions of Windows (most of the time) 	</li><li>Improved form filling for some types of form </li></ul><p>Note that earlier versions of Firefox 6 had a bug which prevented  KeeFox from working. FF6b3+ should work fine, as should Firefox 7a*.
</p>
<p>A full record of changes is available in the changelog as usual: <a href="http://keefox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/keefox/trunk/Firefox%20addon/CHANGELOG.txt" title="Go to http://keefox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/keefox/trunk/Firefox%20addon/CHANGELOG.txt" target="_blank" class="externlink">http://keefox.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/keefox/trunk/Firefox%20addon/CHANGELOG.txt</a>
</p>
<p>Before releasing version 1.0 I will improve documentation / help, add  as many translations as possible and of course fix any bugs that I  can.</p>
