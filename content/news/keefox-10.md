<p>Version 1.0 of KeeFox has been released!
</p>
<p>KeeFox adds free, secure and easy to use password management features  to Firefox which save you time and keep your private data safe and  under your control. KeeFox connects Firefox to KeePass Password Safe,  the most popular open source (and free) password manager.
</p>
<p>Four years, thousands of beta testers and seven international  translations later I am delighted to say that KeeFox can be considered a  stable add-on that is suitable for everyone to use.
</p>
<p>Learn more and find out why hundreds of people think KeeFox deserves a 5 out of 5 star rating on the official home page: <a href="http://keefox.org" title="Go to http://keefox.org" target="_blank" class="externlink">keefox.org</a>
</p>
<p>KeeFox is available for download from the official Firefox add-ons  website. Linux and Mac support is in beta testing so you’ll need to  install the development version at the bottom of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/versions/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/versions/" target="_blank" class="externlink">this page</a>.
</p>
<p>In response to many requests I have begun accepting donations so if  you would like to express your appreciation for KeeFox in this way you  can now do so via a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/about" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/about" target="_blank" class="externlink">contribution on the addons.mozilla.org site </a>.
</p>
<p>Version 1.0 has been subject to some “last minute” polishing for a  number of months now and online help resources have been greatly  improved during that time. While the KeeFox features have not been  improved a huge amount in the past 6 months, I have been hard at work on  version 1.1 which will be available for beta testing soon. Version 1.1  will bring improved support for users with multiple databases and a few  bug fixes.
</p>
<p>I would like to know what you think of KeeFox and what improvements  you would like to see before we reach version 2.0 so please take a  moment to fill in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" title="Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" target="_blank" class="externlink">user survey</a>
</p>
<p>The launch of version 1.0 coincides with a revamped KeeFox website  which I think makes it easier to navigate and more pleasing on the eye;  again, feedback is welcome!
</p>
<p>I’m extremely grateful to everyone that has helped KeeFox reach this  milestone; while I can’t list everyone here there are few that warrant  particular attention.
