<p>In  anticipation of some changes to Firefox that are coming in 2014 and as  part of a wider effort to improve the KeeFox add-on, KeeFox 1.3 will  collect anonymous system statistics and optional anonymous usage  statistics about the way that users interact with the add-on.
</p>
<p>No private data will be collected at any time - things like the URLs  you visit and the contents of your password database entries will never  be collected. Since the data is anonymous, there will be no way for it  to be linked back to you.
</p>
<p>Although the collection of this data does not impact on your privacy,  I have created a privacy policy to help explain what is being sent from  KeeFox so that connections to a KeeFox server do not cause any undue  concern.
</p>
<p>Examples of usage data include things like:<br> 1) A menu item was clicked<br> 2) A KeePass database containing 199 passwords was opened<br> 3) An option was modified
</p>
<p>Basic information about the system KeeFox is running on will be sent  each time your browser starts but all usage statistics can be disabled  if you prefer.
</p>
<p>The full text of the privacy policy can be seen at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/privacy/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/privacy/" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/privacy/</a> and you can find out more about the collection of this data at <a href="https://github.com/luckyrat/KeeFox/wiki/en-%7C-Metrics-collection" title="Go to https://github.com/luckyrat/KeeFox/wiki/en-%7C-Metrics-collection" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://github.com/luckyrat/KeeFox/wiki/en-%7C-Metrics-collection</a>
</p>
<p>KeeFox 1.3 is currently available on the beta testing (development)  channel so we hope that it will be able to pass through the usual  Mozilla Firefox review process within a couple of months.</p>
