<p>I’m  pleased to announce that KeeFox has recently been accepted into the  official Firefox add-ons directory and can now be found at <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/</a>
</p>
<p>After the 30th of June 2011 versions of KeeFox previously downloaded from this website will cease to function so <strong>you will need to install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">version from the Firefox add-ons directory</a> sometime in the next month</strong>.  This expiry time is simply to ensure that no-one gets stuck using  potentially insecure old versions of KeeFox; all future updates will be  delivered automatically in the same way as most Firefox add-ons you  have installed (so a fixed expiry time is no longer required).
</p>
<p>Version 0.8.20 is currently available and can be installed from the  Mozilla add-ons website even if you have already installed version  0.8.20 from this website. Since future updates will be installed  automatically it shouldn’t make a big difference whether you install  KeeFox from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" title="Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/</a> now or when the next update is announced.
</p>
<p>Note that this does not change the beta status of KeeFox. I still  think it is nearly ready for an official “1.0” release and the Mozilla  add-ons review team think that it is “good enough” to be included in the  official directory but there is still work to be done, especially with  respect to documentation.</p>
