<p>To complement version 2.0 of Kee (previously known as KeeFox) I'm pleased to announce that we have a new community discussion forum and a new website.</p>

<p>News and announcements will now be centered around <a href="https://forum.kee.pm">this new discussion forum</a> so if you want to keep up to date with the latest Kee news in future, you should join the community at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm">https://forum.kee.pm</a></p>

<p>As an initial example, you can find this news article on the new community forum at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/new-website-and-community-forum/21">https://forum.kee.pm/t/new-website-and-community-forum/21</a> and if you would like to offer any feedback on this announcement, please feel free to do so there.</p>

<p>http://keefox.org/help will soon direct you straight to the community forum where you will find the latest support information in a format that will allow trusted community members to keep the content up to date as Kee 2.0 moves through beta testing to a full release and beyond.</p>

<p>The new website can be found at <a href="https://www.kee.pm">https://www.kee.pm</a>. As you will see, it is in a transition phase until Kee 2.0 is officially ready for launch. On that note, keep an eye on the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/c/project-news">Project news category</a> on the new community forum for updates on the new version.</p>

<p>The http://keefox.org website will be redirected to https://www.kee.pm in the coming days.</p>

<p>Existing http://keefox.org bookmarks will keep working but you might want to update them anyway.</p>
