<p>The download  page now contains a link to the very latest add-on XPI. As I warn on  the page itself, this will often be untested and may not be as stable as  the latest official version. At time of writing, the latest official  version is still 0.7 (beta) but 0.71 is available for download if you’re  brave enough.
</p>
<p>The test version will be updated occasionally, usually when new  features are ready for testing or bugs have been fixed but not every  change to the development version of KeeFox will be packaged in this way  and not every change to this XPI will be assigned a new version number.
</p>
<p>Some new test version releases will be announced on this website,  usually when an important bug affecting the latest official version has  been fixed or a major piece of new functionality is ready for testing.
</p>
<p>If you want to stay even more up to date, try looking at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/timeline" title="Go to https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/timeline" target="_blank" class="externlink">Trac activity timeline</a>.  It’s possible to customise it using the checkboxes on the right so you  see only those updates you’re interested in and then you can subscribe  to the RSS feed to stay abreast of KeeFox development.
</p>
<p>Version 0.71 should fix intermittent problems with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/ticket/20" title="Go to http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/keefox/ticket/20" target="_blank" class="externlink">toolbar button layout</a> and a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=1" title="Go to http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=1" target="_blank" class="externlink">black background on the logins menu</a> as well as improving the accuracy of the “advanced form detection” option and the manually operated “detect forms” menu button.</p>
