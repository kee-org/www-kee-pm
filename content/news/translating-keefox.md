<p>KeeFox  is now ready for an international audience with translations into  non-English languages. Incomplete Swedish and Russian translations are  available in version 0.9 but complete versions have already been  submitted ready for the version 0.9.1 release, along with Chinese  (Simplified).
</p>
<p>It will be great if we can increase the number of translations over  the next few weeks so that version 0.9.1 can be understood by as many  people as possible. If you (or anyone you know) are willing to  contribute to the translation of KeeFox into other languages please  register on Babelzilla and follow the simple instructions they provide.

</p>
<p>Note that there is currently no way to modify the text of the  KeePassRPC plugin. If anyone has any time to implement a suitable  localisation system for KeePass PLGX plugins I’m sure it will be  appreciated by many KeePass plugin authors. I’m thinking maybe a  seperate plugin or patch for KeePass that allows runtime modification of  strings; it would be good if PLGX compilation were not a requirement  for translators. Please post any further thoughts or offers of help in  the main <a href="help/forum" title="Go to http://keefox.org/help/forum" class="externlink">KeeFox forum</a> or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/forums/forum/329220" title="Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/forums/forum/329220" target="_blank" class="externlink">KeePass forum</a> (depending on how specific your comment or solution is).</p>
