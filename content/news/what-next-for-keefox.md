<p><strong>UPDATE: I’m currently analysing the results of the survey so please post any further suggestions or thoughts on the <a href="help/forum" title="Go to http://keefox.org/help/forum" class="externlink">help forum</a>. I’ll post any interesting results in a new article soon.</strong>
</p>
<p>With KeeFox 1.1 recently released, I thought it would be a good time  to ask you where you think KeeFox should be heading in future. To help  me understand and keep track of your opinions and suggestions I have  created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" title="Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" target="_blank" class="externlink">short survey</a> which I would really appreciate you completing.
</p>
<p>The survey has been active since version 1.0 was released but I’ve  not yet received enough responses to draw any firm conclusions from the  current results so please take a moment to answer the questions in the  survey that you can find here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" title="Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ" target="_blank" class="externlink">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/view … rmkey=dEVIOHNxMnAtTy00c0w4TDVjX2loY3c6MQ</a>
</p>
<p>I’ll analyse the responses and then post a summary of the results in a couple of months.
</p>
<p>If you have any further suggestions or questions in the mean time, don’t forget to check out the help resources at <a href="help/" title="Go to http://keefox.org/help/" class="externlink">http://keefox.org/help/</a>
</p>
<p>If you have already completed the survey then thank you! I’ve not had  time to read individual comments yet but will definitely do so soon.</p>
