<p><strong>This policy applies only to the website<a href="#c185" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">*</a>, NOT Kee itself.</strong><br> 
</p>
<h3>Data collection and retention</h3>
<p>This website does not collect any personal data.</p>

<h3>Automatically collected data</h3>
<p>As with the vast majority of web sites, the Kee website automatically logs information about every request made of it. This information is used for system administration, for bug tracking, and for producing anonymous usage statistics. The logged information may be kept indefinitely.
</p>
<p>This anonymous data may on occasion be passed to the administrators of other computer systems/networks to enable investigation of abuse, problems accessing this site or misconfiguration. Otherwise the logged information is not passed to any third party except if required by law.<br> 
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies (small files stored on your computerâ€™s hard drive) are not required by the Kee website directly but some third party services require their use.
</p>
<p>Kee uses Google Analytics to anonymously monitor site usage and this information helps to improve the site. No individuals are identified in this process but the analytics does require the setting of some cookies.</p>

<div id="c185"><p>* i.e. this policy applies only to pages with addresses beginning with <a href="https://www.kee.pm" target="_blank">www.kee.pm</a> (so addresses such as <a href="https://www.kee.pm/help/forum" target="_blank">www.kee.pm/help/forum</a> which immediately redirect elsewhere may have separate policies).</p></div>
