We care deeply about helping everyone secure their passwords. Our company values hardwire this into everything we do.

Whenever those values align with an opportunity to offer our software for free we will do so, and the rest of the time we will price our software and services as generously as possible.

<p>Our "Supporter Monthly" subscription is only £2 per month. Until the more expensive subscription plans are launched, all Supporters get access to all newly developed features of those plans.</p>

<p>We don’t offer refunds on partially used subscriptions but with the free trial and very cheap monthly subscription option we hope this seems reasonable to you.</p>



We currently offer only one subscription plan but since some service features might cost significantly more to run in the future, we may introduce additional options one day. Future features will be added to whichever subscription plan can most efficiently cover the costs of developing and maintaining the feature so that we're always giving you the best possible value for money.
